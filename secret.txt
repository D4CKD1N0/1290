Teleportation is the hypothetical transfer of matter or energy from one point to another without traversing the physical space between them. 
It is a common subject in science fiction literature and in other popular culture.
Teleportation is often paired with time travel, being that the travelling between the two points takes an unknown period of time, sometimes being immediate.

Frequently appearing scientific papers and media articles with the term teleportation typically report on so-called "quantum teleportation", a scheme for information transfer which, due to the no-communication theorem, still would not allow for faster-than-light communication.


**Etymology**
The use of the term teleport to describe the hypothetical movement of material objects between one place and another without physically traversing the distance between them has been documented as early as 1878.

American writer Charles Fort is credited with having coined the word teleportation in 1931 to describe the strange disappearances and appearances of anomalies, which he suggested may be connected. As in the earlier usage, he joined the Greek prefix tele- (meaning "remote") to the root of the Latin verb portare 
Fort's first formal use of the word occurred in the second chapter of his 1931 book Lo! 

    Mostly in this book I shall specialize upon indications that there exists a transportory force that I shall call Teleportation. I shall be accused of having assembled lies, yarns, hoaxes, and superstitions. To some degree I think so, myself. To some degree, I do not. I offer the data.
